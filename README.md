leap-mouse
==========
Use a stick to control your mouse! The cursor will follow the movements of your magic wand.  Also, you can "poke" your screen to right-click (jab your stick forward)

The main program can be found in `mouse_control.py`.  Run this python script with a LeapMotion device connected to test.
